'''
    Since harmony in music can be expressed in letters,
    music in it's abstract form can be seen as a context
    free language (CFL)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_language
    
    This method allows to create basic musical harmonies
    using letters which makes it easy enough to explore
    and experiment with scales and chord progressions
    
    in the `context` below the numbers 1 ~ 7 represent
    tonal degrees in a 7 note scale (M, m, ...) 
    T - Tonic chords
    S - Sub dominant chords
    D - Dominant chords
